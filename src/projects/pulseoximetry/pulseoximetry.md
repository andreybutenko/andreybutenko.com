Developed an Android app which computes heart rate and blood oxygen content based on IR and red light data. Data is transmitted from a measurement device to the phone wirelessly via NFC.

Worked with [UW Sensor Labs](https://sensor.cs.washington.edu) under Professor Joshua Smith and Vaishnavi Ranganathan.
