As I'm wrapping up Winter Quarter of my Junior year at the University of Washington, I am prioritizing doing my best work in my classes. Meanwhile, I am preparing for upcoming challenges in my work as an Assistant Resident Director as COVID-19 impacts Seattle.

* In my Winter 2020 courses, I am most proud of my work in creating my [student leadership portfolio](https://leadership.andreybutenko.com), developing a [data visualization of Australian wildfires](https://andreybutenko.github.io/d3-australian-wildfires-over-time/), and designing [a tool to promote student night safety](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sV9Vdxv8yPvD5FxUr3e7WhCpf4VHbA-l7HcNoJ6NJwA).

* As an Assistant Resident Director at the University of Washington, I am responsible for facilitating community development in a building of 400 students, which will become more important but more challenging as COVID-19 requires social distancing.

Looking ahead, I am excited to help teach the class for incoming Resident Advisers in Spring Quarter and joining Amazon as a Software Development Intern in the summer.
